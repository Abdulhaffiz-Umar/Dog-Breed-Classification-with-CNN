### Introduction 
In recent years, there have seen a decline in the number of approaches available for the processing and categorization of pictures, making image research a challenging endeavor. However, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an evolving spectrum of artificial deep learning technique that offers promising results in image recognition and classification.

This project will showcase a comprehensive exposition on how CNN can be used to classify dog breeds using sing the Keras open-source neural network library connected to a TensorFlow backend in Python.

### Dependencies 

* Python 3
* sklearn
* Numpy
* TensorFlow
* keras
* glob
* matplotlib
* tqdm

Note: The list of all the libraries used can be found in the project notebook.
